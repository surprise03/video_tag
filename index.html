    <h2>About the series</h2>
    <p>In a world where hunters — human warriors who possess supernatural abilities — must battle deadly monsters to
        protect mankind from certain annihilation, a notoriously weak hunter named Sung Jinwoo finds himself in a
        seemingly endless struggle for survival. One day, after narrowly surviving an overwhelmingly powerful double
        dungeon that nearly wipes out his entire party, a mysterious program called the System chooses him as its sole
        player and in turn, gives him the unique ability to level up in strength. This is something no other hunter is
        able to do, as a hunter's abilities are set once they awaken. Jinwoo then sets out on a journey as he fights
        against all kinds of enemies, both man and monster, to discover the secrets of the dungeons and the true source
        of his powers. He soon discovers that he has been chosen to inherit the position of Shadow Monarch, essentially
        turning him into an immortal necromancer who has absolute rule over the dead. He is the only Monarch who fights
        to save humanity, as the other Monarchs are all trying to kill him and wipe out the humans.</p>


    <p><b>Shadow army</b>An immortal race that were resurrected by the power of the Shadow Monarch, which is an
        extraction of mana from both monsters and hunters. Unlike summons from other hunters, they are capable of
        growth, and speech, and have the highest amount of warriors, to the point that their sheer numbers surpass all
        the top guilds. There are multiple grades of shadow soldiers, including basic grade, normal grade, elite grade,
        knight grade, elite knight grade, commander/general grade, marshal/commander grade, and Grand Marshal grade.
        Only soldiers of commander/general grade can speak.</p>
